# JavaScript Basics

Some commonly used JavaScript inbuilt functions which can be used over large arrays of data and objects to reduce the operation time of the instructions.

## Map function
Summarized the following topics - 
  * Why is map function used
  * How is map function used
  * Importance of map function
 
## Find and Filter functions
Laconic information on - 
  * Advantages of using find and filter functions
  * How can find and filter be used on array of simple data and array of objects
  * Brief examples of the aforementioned functions

## Objects & object keys
Expressed various techniques on how to use the object keys and append additional keys dynamically to the existing object. These techniques are - 
  * Dot notation
  * Bracket notation

## Unique Values
This topic illustrates, rom a list of data, how to fetch the unique values. This is achieved using the **Set** data type.

## Destructuring
  ### Arrays
   * How to destructure arrays
   * Importance of using the simplified destructuring methods
  ### Objects
   * Methods to destructure objects
   * Accessing destructured elements in functions 

## Reduce
Usage of reduce method to deduce some aggregate values from a simple array as well as array of objects. Examples of objects and simple array to illustrate the reduce functionality.

## Spread Operator
Importance of spread operator in copying the arrays and objects and not referencing them. Copying a smaller object in the larger object or creating a flat array from multiple arrays.

## Rest Operator
Using rest operator to fetch the other data except a few know. Using the rest operator in functions. Understanding the difference when to use spread operator and rest operator in functions.
